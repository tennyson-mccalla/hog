# hog
Find out the total memory percentage used by some named process

## requirements
Use Python 3.6+ for best results.

## usage
- make hog file executable with `chmod +x hog`
- place it somewhere in the path
- call it with `hog <process name>`

## explanation
I originally made this to track the percentage of memory that Chrome took up on this slow, resource constrained, Lenovo I'm using. I realized that it could be generalized and so altered it then uploaded it here.

## to do
- [x] Solve Python2 and Python3 issues.
- [x] Make a nicer output.
- [x] Comment code.
